== Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

=== Reporting Channel

* *Email*: Open an issue with `[SECURITY]` prefix (for non-critical)
* *Private disclosure*: Contact maintainer directly for critical vulnerabilities

=== Response SLA

* *Acknowledgement*: Within 24 hours
* *Initial assessment*: Within 72 hours
* *Resolution timeline*: Depends on severity, typically 7-30 days

=== What to Include

. Description of the vulnerability
. Steps to reproduce
. Potential impact assessment
. Suggested fix (if any)

=== Scope

This policy covers:

* The polyglot-db-mcp server code
* Database adapter implementations
* Configuration handling

Out of scope:

* Vulnerabilities in upstream database systems
* Issues in npm dependencies (report upstream)

== Security Considerations

=== Database Credentials

* Never commit credentials to version control
* Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
* Credentials are never logged or exposed in error messages

=== Network Security

* All database connections should use TLS where supported
* No default passwords are used
* Connection strings are validated before use

=== Input Validation

* All user inputs are validated before database operations
* SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
* JSON inputs are parsed safely with error handling

== Security Headers (for HTTP-based databases)

When connecting to HTTP-based databases (XTDB, Meilisearch, Qdrant), ensure:

* TLS 1.3 for production
* Proper authentication headers
* No sensitive data in URLs
