================================================================================

We encourage adopters to additionally apply the Palimpsest License, which adds
ethical guidelines for AI-assisted development without restricting the base
license rights. The Palimpsest License promotes:

  - Transparent AI attribution
  - Ethical data sourcing
  - Responsible AI deployment
  - Community benefit sharing

This is NOT a requirement — the MIT or AGPL license alone is sufficient for
legal use of this software.
